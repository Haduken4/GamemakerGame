Space Top-Down Scrolling Shooter

Weapon unlocking & switching (left & right guns can be swapped out)
Tutorial does 1st mission, teaches player about weapon shop & weapon switching along with game's combat.
(Some number) Of planets, must do tutorial planet first, then other planets may be done in any order,
however planets would differ in difficulty.
Weapons have 5 tiers, first 3 tiers cost (currency), tiers 4 and 5 would cost (currency) & some materials
dropped from bosses.
Completing some missions (Maybe completing a planet?) unlocks a new blueprint, which you can pay the
gun crafter to make into a weapon.
Endless mode: Open space, sends progressively harder waves of enemies with amped up versions of bosses
every certain amount of waves. May also unlock different color schemes.
Each planet is unique in some way other than having a different boss.
Currency is earned through completing missions & killing enemies during missions.

Replayability factors: Endless mode (to a certain extent, would probably get boring after a while),
maybe challenge modes? (Such as planet missions with stronger enemies), Trying missions with different
weapons, unlocking higher weapon tiers (may require multiple boss kills), ACHIEVEMENTS (in all caps
because its important for a game of this type, achievements could include bronze - silver - gold medals
on missions (for killing 60%, 85%, 100% of enemies on a mission) or getting some amount of waves in
endless mode). this amount of replayability factors may not be enough to make the game worth it, need to
think of more. 


Main Story: You are a gifted member of the rebel faction, tasked with freeing the planets of
(solar system name) from the tyranny of (enemy faction name). The rebel faction is short on members and
entrusted you alone with completing this mission.
